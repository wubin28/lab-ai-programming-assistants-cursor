# DeepSeek Service Unit Test

## Overview

This unit test focuses on the `DeepSeekService` class, which is responsible for integrating with the DeepSeek API. The test verifies that the service correctly calls the API and handles its responses and errors.

## Key Components Tested

1. **OpenAI Client Integration**:
   - The test verifies that the DeepSeek API is called with the correct parameters
   - Uses mock objects to avoid making real API calls
   - Tests both success and error scenarios

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - The DeepSeekService now accepts an OpenAI client as a constructor parameter
   - This allows for easy mocking during tests

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Tests that API errors are properly caught and propagated

## Implementation Details

The test uses `jest-mock-extended` to create a mock of the OpenAI client. This allows us to:

1. Verify that the correct parameters are sent to the API
2. Simulate API responses without making real API calls
3. Test error handling by having the mock throw errors

## Running the Test

```bash
npm test -- src/tests/services/deepseek.service.test.ts
```

## Production Code Changes

To support testability, the following changes were made to the production code:

1. **Dependency Injection**: The DeepSeekService now accepts an OpenAI client in its constructor
2. **Interface Definition**: An IDeepSeekService interface was created to support better DI patterns
3. **Singleton Pattern**: A singleton class was created for production use

These changes follow the dependency injection pattern recommended in the architecture document, which suggests using TSyringe for dependency management.

## Next Steps

Additional tests that could be implemented include:

1. Testing the streaming API functionality
2. Testing the controller layer that uses the DeepSeekService
3. Integration tests that verify the entire request/response flow
